# Edufocus
An open source server-authority bot aimed to guide safe conversations, especially in servers for schools or other educational institutions.

## What's This For?
This bot is aimed for use where you want to encourage inclusive conversations. For example, you wouldn't want students using profanity in a server for your school.

## What Does This Do?
This bot automatically moderates custom statuses, nicknames, usernames, and messages. You can enable or disable functionality in simple ini-based config files, or the planned configuration editor.
